# Kokoro-82M-Android
A minimal Android demo app for **Kokoro-82M** TTS model in int8 quantization.

Kokoro-82M origin model: https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M<br>
Kokoro-82M int8-quant model: https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx

Many features of the original model have not been implemented. This is just a simple Android on-device inference demo and also the first Android app I have developed. :)

A huge thank you to the open-source projects and communities that made this project possible. Your contributions are invaluable.
